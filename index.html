<h1>VLOG #3</h1>
            <h2>One of the best experience in Negros</h2>
            <p>One of the most beautiful falls I have ever seen. It was just one and half hours drive from Bacolod city. At first I was skeptical if water was really turquoise as seen on Youtube but my fam and I were amazed as it really was! Water is a bit cold and rocks are slippery so just take extra careful. Also, be prepared with the 108 steps ascending from the falls going back to the cottages. I find that two trips back and forth was a great workout for the day. You can take a few steps at a time though as long as no one is behind you as you would definitely cause a delay if you stop.</p>

            <h2>A Laid-Back City in Southern Negros Occidental</h2>
            <p>Together with our family, we spent three days and two nights in Sipalay. Since the town boasts a scenic landscape, we decided to spend one night in an island resort, one night in a beachfront resort, and visited two other resorts which are known for stunning views. </p>

<h1>VLOG #6</h1>
            <h2>Located in Kabankalan City</h2>
            <p>Agustina Falls is the perfect place for swimming during summer time while the heat is scorching. Wear slippers or Aqua shoes is better. Bring your own food as there are no vendors. Weekdays are quieter days to visit.</p>
